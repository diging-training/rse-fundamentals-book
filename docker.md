## What issues have you experienced when trying to run or use research software?

Does any of the following sound familiar?

- Software doesn’t exist for your operating system.
- Software needs other packages and software to run that need to be installed (dependencies).
- Dependencies don’t install or are not available for your system.
- There are different versions of software you and your colleagues use that behave differently.
- Users of the software you have written have trouble installing it.
- The software or version you or your colleagues have used for a research project doesn’t exist anymore.
